# Digit-Recognizer
Digit Recognizer is a Kaggle based competition. In this competition, goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Implemented different machine learning algorithms (Convolutional Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Method) to improve the accuracy of model.
